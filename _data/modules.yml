- description: This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in adm_build_path()
    function of sadmind daemon. The distributed system administration daemon (sadmind)
    is the daemon used by Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed
    system administration operations. The sadmind daemon is started automatically
    by the inetd daemon whenever a request to invoke an operation is received. The
    sadmind daemon process continues to run for 15 minutes after the last request
    is completed, unless a different idle-time is specified with the -i command line
    option. The sadmind daemon may be started independently from the command line,
    for example, at system boot time. In this case, the -i option has no effect; sadmind
    continues to run, even if there are no active requests.
